# python-build

python-build is a [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) plugin that
provides a `pyenv install` command to compile and install different versions
of Python on UNIX-like systems.

You can also use python-build without pyenv in environments where you need
precise control over Python version installation.

See the [list of releases](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/releases)
for changes in each version.


## Installation

### Installing as an pyenv plugin (recommended)

You need nothing to do since python-build is bundled with pyenv by
default.

### Installing as a standalone program (advanced)

Installing python-build as a standalone program will give you access to the
`python-build` command for precise control over Python version installation. If you
have pyenv installed, you will also be able to use the `pyenv install` command.

    git clone git://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git
    cd pyenv/plugins/python-build
    ./install.sh

This will install python-build into `/usr/local`. If you do not have write
permission to `/usr/local`, you will need to run `sudo ./install.sh` instead.
You can install to a different prefix by setting the `PREFIX` environment
variable.

To update python-build after it has been installed, run `git pull` in your cloned
copy of the repository, then re-run the install script.

### Installing with Homebrew (for OS X users)

Mac OS X users can install python-build with the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
package manager. This will give you access to the `python-build` command. If you
have pyenv installed, you will also be able to use the `pyenv install` command.

*This is the recommended method of installation if you installed pyenv with
Homebrew.*

    brew install pyenv

Or, if you would like to install the latest development release:

    brew install --HEAD pyenv


## Usage

Before you begin, you should ensure that your build environment has the proper
system dependencies for compiling the wanted Python Version (see our [recommendations](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment)).

### Using `pyenv install` with pyenv

To install a Python version for use with pyenv, run `pyenv install` with
exact name of the version you want to install. For example,

    pyenv install 2.7.4

Python versions will be installed into a directory of the same name under
`~/.pyenv/versions`.

To see a list of all available Python versions, run `pyenv install --list`. You
may also tab-complete available Python versions if your pyenv installation is
properly configured.

### Using `python-build` standalone

If you have installed python-build as a standalone program, you can use the
`python-build` command to compile and install Python versions into specific
locations.

Run the `python-build` command with the exact name of the version you want to
install and the full path where you want to install it. For example,

    python-build 2.7.4 ~/local/python-2.7.4

To see a list of all available Python versions, run `python-build --definitions`.

Pass the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to `python-build` as the first argument to see
what's happening under the hood.

### Custom definitions

Both `pyenv install` and `python-build` accept a path to a custom definition file
in place of a version name. Custom definitions let you develop and install
versions of Python that are not yet supported by python-build.

See the [python-build built-in definitions](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/tree/master/plugins/python-build/share/python-build) as a starting point for
custom definition files.

[definitions]: https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/tree/master/plugins/python-build/share/python-build

### Special environment variables

You can set certain environment variables to control the build process.

* `TMPDIR` sets the location where python-build stores temporary files.
* `PYTHON_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` sets the location in which sources are downloaded and
  built. By default, this is a subdirectory of `TMPDIR`.
* `PYTHON_BUILD_CACHE_PATH`, if set, specifies a directory to use for caching
  downloaded package files.
* `PYTHON_BUILD_MIRROR_URL` overrides the default mirror URL root to one of your
  choosing.
* `PYTHON_BUILD_SKIP_MIRROR`, if set, forces python-build to download packages from
  their original source URLs instead of using a mirror.
* `PYTHON_BUILD_ROOT` overrides the default location from where build definitions
  in `share/python-build/` are looked up.
* `PYTHON_BUILD_DEFINITIONS` can be a list of colon-separated paths that get
  additionally searched when looking up build definitions.
* `CC` sets the path to the C compiler.
* `PYTHON_CFLAGS` lets you pass additional options to the default `CFLAGS`. Use
  this to override, for instance, the `-O3` option.
* `CONFIGURE_OPTS` lets you pass additional options to `./configure`.
* `MAKE` lets you override the command to use for `make`. Useful for specifying
  GNU make (`gmake`) on some systems.
* `MAKE_OPTS` (or `MAKEOPTS`) lets you pass additional options to `make`.
* `MAKE_INSTALL_OPTS` lets you pass additional options to `make install`.
* `PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS` and `PYTHON_MAKE_OPTS` and `PYTHON_MAKE_INSTALL_OPTS` allow
  you to specify configure and make options for buildling CPython. These variables
  will be passed to Python only, not any dependent packages (e.g. libyaml).

### Applying patches to Python before compiling

Both `pyenv install` and `python-build` support the `--patch` (`-p`) flag that
signals that a patch from stdin should be applied to Python, Jython or PyPy
source code before the `./configure` and compilation steps.

Example usage:

```sh
# applying a single patch
$ pyenv install --patch 2.7.10 < /path/to/python.patch

# applying a patch from HTTP
$ pyenv install --patch 2.7.10 < <(curl -sSL http://git.io/python.patch)

# applying multiple patches
$ cat fix1.patch fix2.patch | pyenv install --patch 2.7.10
```


### Building with `--enable-shared`

You can build CPython with `--enable-shared` to install a version with
shared object.

If `--enabled-shared` was found in `PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS` or `CONFIGURE_OPTS`,
`python-build` will automatically set `RPATH` to the pyenv's prefix directory.
This means you don't have to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for
the version(s) installed with `--enable-shared`.

```sh
$ env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared` pyenv install 2.7.9
```

### Checksum verification

If you have the `shasum`, `openssl`, or `sha256sum` tool installed, python-build will
automatically verify the SHA2 checksum of each downloaded package before
installing it.

Checksums are optional and specified as anchors on the package URL in each
definition. (All bundled definitions include checksums.)

### Package download mirrors

python-build will first attempt to download package files from a mirror hosted on
GitHub Pages. If a package is not available on the mirror, if the mirror
is down, or if the download is corrupt, python-build will fall back to the
official URL specified in the defintion file.

You can point python-build to another mirror by specifying the
`PYTHON_BUILD_MIRROR_URL` environment variable--useful if you'd like to run your
own local mirror, for example. Package mirror URLs are constructed by joining
this variable with the SHA2 checksum of the package file.

If you don't have an SHA2 program installed, python-build will skip the download
mirror and use official URLs instead. You can force python-build to bypass the
mirror by setting the `PYTHON_BUILD_SKIP_MIRROR` environment variable.

The official python-build download mirror is provided by
[GitHub Pages](http://yyuu.github.io/pythons/).

### Package download caching

You can instruct python-build to keep a local cache of downloaded package files
by setting the `PYTHON_BUILD_CACHE_PATH` environment variable. When set, package
files will be kept in this directory after the first successful download and
reused by subsequent invocations of `python-build` and `pyenv install`.

The `pyenv install` command defaults this path to `~/.pyenv/cache`, so in most
cases you can enable download caching simply by creating that directory.

### Keeping the build directory after installation

Both `python-build` and `pyenv install` accept the `-k` or `--keep` flag, which
tells python-build to keep the downloaded source after installation. This can be
useful if you need to use `gdb` and `memprof` with Python.

Source code will be kept in a parallel directory tree `~/.pyenv/sources` when
using `--keep` with the `pyenv install` command. You should specify the
location of the source code with the `PYTHON_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` environment
variable when using `--keep` with `python-build`.
