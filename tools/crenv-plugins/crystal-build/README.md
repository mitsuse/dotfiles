crystal-build is an [crenv](https://github.com/pine613/crenv) plugin that provides an crenv install command.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pine613/crystal-build.git ~/.crenv/plugins/crystal-build
```

crystal-build currently supports only download a compiled tarball.

## Usage
### Using `crenv install` with crenv

To install a Crystal version for use with crenv, run `crenv install` with the exact name of the version you want to install. For example,

```
crenv install 0.7.4
```

Crystal versions will be installed into a directory of the same name under `~/.crenv/versions`.

To see a list of all available Crystal versions, run `crenv install --list`.

### Special environment variables

```
$ carton install
$ carton exec -- prove -r t # all
$ carton exec -- prove t/<dir>/<file>.t
```
